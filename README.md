# Data Quality Rule Validation System for Investment Banking

## Project Description

### Business Problem

In modern investment banking operations, data flows through multiple systems from front-office trading platforms to back-office settlement systems and regulatory reporting systems. Ensuring data quality and consistency across this complex ecosystem is critical for:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting stringent financial regulations and reporting requirements
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating data-related operational risks
- **Operational Efficiency**: Reducing manual data reconciliation and error correction
- **Data Integrity**: Maintaining accurate and consistent data across all systems

Traditional data quality approaches often rely on siloed validation rules that don't consider the complete data lineage. This project addresses this challenge by implementing a **graph database-driven approach** that defines Critical Data Elements (CDEs) and Data Quality (DQ) Rules from a comprehensive data lineage perspective.

### Solution Overview

This system uses **Neo4j graph database** to model the relationships between:
- **Critical Data Elements (CDEs)**: Key data fields that flow through trading systems
- **Data Quality Rules**: Validation logic applied to ensure data integrity
- **System Dependencies**: How data flows from Front Office → Settlement → Reporting systems

The solution validates DQ rules across three core systems:
1. **Front Office Trading System** (MySQL)
2. **Back Office Settlement System** (MySQL)  
3. **Regulatory Reporting System** (MySQL)

By taking a **data lineage perspective**, the system can identify violations that might be missed by traditional point-in-time validation approaches.

## Applications

This project consists of **three complementary applications** built using **CrewAI** as the agentic framework:

### Application 1: Graph Database Management Tool
**Purpose**: Modify Neo4j graph database CDEs and DQ Rules using natural language

**Key Features**:
- Natural language processing to understand CDE and DQ Rule modifications
- Automatic conversion of plain English instructions to Cypher queries
- Safe execution of graph database updates
- Validation of changes before applying to production graph

**Use Case**: "Add a new DQ rule that ensures all trade amounts are positive and greater than $1000"

### Application 2: Data Quality Validation Engine  
**Purpose**: Apply DQ Rules from the graph database across all three relational database systems

**Key Features**:
- Retrieves CDEs and DQ Rules from Neo4j graph database
- Validates rules across Trade, Settlement, and Reporting systems
- Generates comprehensive violation reports
- Provides system-by-system analysis and recommendations

**Use Case**: Nightly validation runs to identify data quality violations across the trading pipeline

### Application 3: GraphDB Query UI
**Purpose**: Interactive web interface for querying the Neo4j graph database with natural language

**Key Features**:
- 🤖 **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- ⚡ **Direct Cypher Execution**: Write and execute Cypher queries directly
- 📊 **Schema Visualization**: View database structure and sample data
- 🔍 **Real-time Results**: See query results in formatted tables
- 💡 **Example Queries**: Pre-built examples to get you started
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design that works on all devices

**Use Cases**:
- "Show me all CDEs with their associated rules"
- "What rules are associated with Trade Date?"
- "Find CDEs that have NOT_NULL rules"
- "Show me all systems and their CDEs"

#### Quick Start for GraphDB Query UI

**Prerequisites**:
1. **Python 3.7+** installed
2. **Neo4j Database** running with your graph data
3. **OpenAI API Key** for natural language processing
4. **Required Python packages** (see installation below)

**Installation**:
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"  # Linux/Mac
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here       # Windows

# Start the UI
python graphdb_ui.py

# Or use the startup scripts
./run_graphdb_ui.sh          # Linux/Mac
```

**Access**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:5050`

#### Usage

**Natural Language Queries**:
The UI can understand questions like:
- "Show me all CDEs"
- "Find all data quality rules"
- "What rules are associated with Trade Date?"
- "Show me all systems and their CDEs"
- "Find CDEs that have NOT_NULL rules"

**Direct Cypher Queries**:
For advanced users, you can write Cypher queries directly:
```cypher
MATCH (cde:CDE)-[:HAS_RULE]->(rule:DQRule)
RETURN cde.name, rule.description
```

**Example Queries**:
The UI includes several example queries you can click to try:
1. **Show me all CDEs** - Lists all Critical Data Elements
2. **Find all data quality rules** - Shows all DQ rules in the database
3. **What rules are associated with Trade Date?** - Shows rules for a specific CDE
4. **Show me all systems and their CDEs** - Displays system-CDE relationships
5. **Find CDEs that have NOT_NULL rules** - Filters CDEs by rule type

#### Database Schema

The UI is designed to work with a Neo4j database containing:

**Node Types**:
- **CDE** (Critical Data Element): `name`, `description`, `dataType`
- **DQRule** (Data Quality Rule): `id`, `description`, `ruleType`
- **System**: `name`, `dbType`, `dbTable`, `description`

**Relationships**:
- `(CDE)-[:HAS_RULE]->(DQRule)` - Links CDEs to their quality rules
- `(System)-[:HAS_CDE]->(CDE)` - Links systems to their CDEs

#### API Endpoints

The UI provides several REST API endpoints:

**`GET /api/schema`**:
Returns database schema information including node counts, relationship counts, and sample data.

**`POST /api/query`**:
Processes natural language queries:
```json
{
  "query": "Show me all CDEs"
}
```

**`POST /api/cypher`**:
Executes direct Cypher queries:
```json
{
  "query": "MATCH (cde:CDE) RETURN cde"
}
```

#### Configuration

**Neo4j Connection**:
The UI uses the existing `Neo4jConnection` class from `neo4j_tools.py`. Make sure your Neo4j connection settings are correct:

```python
# Default settings in neo4j_tools.py
uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
user = "neo4j"
password = "testtest"
database = "neo4j"
```

**OpenAI Configuration**:
The natural language processing uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. You can modify the model in `graphdb_ui.py`:

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Change to gpt-4 for better results
    temperature=0.1,
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

#### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues**:

1. **"Neo4j connection failed"**
   - Ensure Neo4j database is running
   - Check connection settings in `neo4j_tools.py`
   - Verify database contains the expected schema

2. **"Required packages not installed"**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.7+

3. **"OpenAI API key not set"**
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Natural language queries won't work without this

4. **"Query contains potentially dangerous operations"**
   - The UI blocks DELETE, DROP, and REMOVE operations for safety
   - Use direct Cypher execution for administrative operations

**Debug Mode**:
```bash
python graphdb_ui.py --debug
```

**Logs**: Check the console output for detailed error messages and query execution logs.

#### Security Considerations

- The UI blocks potentially dangerous Cypher operations (DELETE, DROP, REMOVE)
- All queries are logged for audit purposes
- Consider running behind a reverse proxy for production use
- Ensure proper authentication for production deployments

## Known Issues

### Hard-Coded CDEs and DQ Rules
**Issue**: Some Critical Data Elements and Data Quality Rules have been hard-coded during development with **Cursor AI code generation**. This creates maintenance challenges and reduces system flexibility.

**Impact**:
- Adding new CDEs requires code modifications
- DQ Rule changes may not be automatically detected
- System is not fully generic for all trading scenarios

**Investigation Needed**: 
- Analyze Cursor's code generation patterns and limitations
- Evaluate other AI code generation tools (GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Windsurf)
- Develop best practices for maintaining generic, data-driven code

### Non-Deterministic Agentic Behavior
**Issue**: Due to the **agentic AI approach** using CrewAI and LLMs, output results are not always deterministic.

**Symptoms**:
- Occasional variations in validation reports
- Different agent responses to identical inputs
- Inconsistent handling of edge cases

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Enhanced prompt engineering for more consistent outputs
- Validation checks and retries for critical operations
- Comprehensive testing with known expected results

### System Integration Complexity
**Issue**: Integration between Neo4j graph database and multiple MySQL systems creates complexity in data synchronization and consistency.

**Challenges**:
- Schema evolution across different database types
- Performance optimization for large-scale validation
- Error handling across distributed systems

## Troubleshooting

### Resolved Issues (Historical Reference)

#### No Violations Detected (Previously Fixed)
**Symptoms**: System reports 0 violations when violations should exist
**Root Cause**: DQ Validator agent wasn't calling mysql_validation for all CDEs
**Solution**: Enhanced validation task with explicit instructions and tool calls for each CDE

#### N/A Values in Results (Previously Fixed)
**Symptoms**: Detailed results show "N/A" instead of "OK" or "VIOLATION"
**Root Cause**: Report Generator treating available columns as unavailable
**Solution**: Enhanced report generation task with specific validation checks

#### Incorrect System Analysis (Previously Fixed)
**Symptoms**: System analysis shows wrong percentages
**Root Cause**: Improper calculation of violations per system
**Solution**: Explicit instructions for 1 violation per system calculation

### Current Issue Troubleshooting

#### MySQL Connection Failures
- Verify database configurations in `mysql_config.py`
- Check database server availability
- Confirm user credentials and permissions
- Use option 2 (Connection Test) to diagnose issues

#### Neo4j Connection Issues
- Ensure Neo4j database is running
- Verify connection settings in `neo4j_tools.py`
- Check that CDEs and DQ rules exist in the graph
- Use `python test/test_graph_data.py` to verify graph structure

#### OpenAI API Issues
